    "Most insects utilize a pair of antennae to sense their near-range environment. When blindfolded these insects are still capable of climbing obstacles and finding footholds for their front legs using their antennae [[Dürr01]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22098903). Different types of mechanoreceptors present in each antenna, are involved to perform this kind of orientation. One of these receptors - the Johnston's organ - is correlated to the sensing of antennal vibrations [[JC96]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02346378).\n",
    "As vibrations are characterized by their amplitude, frequency and phase, all further information about the origin of the vibration is encoded in these properties. This includes forces applied to the antenna on movement or on a contact with another object.\n",
    "Prior approaches to construct a biomimetic antenna have proven, that vibration properties can be exploited to estimate a position of a contact on the antenna or material properties and texture of any touched object [[KM04]](http://www.ti.uni-bielefeld.de/downloads/publications/whisker3.pdf). .....\n",
    "\n",
    ">Therefore an artificial antenna needs to be constructed that is capable of providing distance information of objects with sufficient precision and a small latency. For footstep planning, the robot needs to get an immediate feedback of it’s surroundings, especially when the knowledge is restricted to the range of the robot. In the hereinafter described experiment, the properties and performance of an antenna that utilizes a piezoelectric sensor gets explored. More precisely it is examined, whether the signal from this antenna contains the required distance estimation on objects it touches."
